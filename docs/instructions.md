Create a professional static HTML website for my apartment rental business in South Central PA. 

I have 1 property to list with 3 units, but plan to expand in the future. Design should be modern and clean with a trustworthy feel - use blues and whites for the color scheme.

HOME PAGE 

Home page with brief intro and preview of properties.  Emphasis should be on local landlord (not a corporation), providing quality, clean rental units at a fair price.  

OUR PROPERTIES PAGE

The only property we currently have is 125 W Second Street in Waynesboro, PA 17268.  It is a three story walkup built in 1899. It started as a large single family home and was converted to apartments in the 1950s.
The apartment unit is in the heart of downtown and close to restaurants and breweries.  

Each unit pays for its gas and electric.  
Landlord pays Water, Sewer, Trash, and Hot Water.  
No pets are allowed.

SELLING YOUR PROPERTY PAGE

This page should be focused on folks who want to sell.  I will consider buying any property, no need for realtors, in any condition etc... I am very interested in multifamily acquisitions.  Again, use the web for inspiration for this page, but do not plagiarize.  The page needs to be unique and not be a copy of something else.  

ABOUT PAGE

About page explaining my business and why guests should choose us.  I have 5 years of experience in managing this property.  I am local to South Central PA and love this area.  I take pride in my apratments and want to provide comfortable well maintained properties for my clients.  I also care about the neighborhood and future of Waynesboro and want to see Waynesboro thrive and be reinvigorated.    This section can include a photo of me, but just use a placeholder for now.  


Contact page with a form (name, email, phone (optional), message).  This should create an email and send to contact@sharp-apartments.com.  I will need instructions to create this email as an alias for jamie@sharp-apartments.com (my Google Workspace Email).

I also have a Facebook page here that still needs to be completed - https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61587066134883
I am not on Insta but can be if you recommend it.  


Technical Considerations.  

You may use free stock images as needed to enhance the website.  

I have a Github account and this website content will need to be synced there.  

I am interested in hosting this for free and will need guidance to setup the free hosting and link it to my domain.  sharp-apartments.com is managed by GoDaddy.  I can provide credentials.  

The website should be static, clean, and simple.  It should look professional.  There is no need for a lot of bells and whistles.
